Reporting is tailored to support the decision making needs of each role, including alerts that drive teams to take action and escalate issues. Dynamic reports provide teams with the flexibility to explore emerging questions. For example, multiple teams who support a specific retail purchase (e.g., web, store, merchandising) receive that customerâ€˜s feedback with aggregated reports and views relevant to their team.</div>
